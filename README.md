# **Country Data Management API** üåç

## Overview
A robust RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and Sequelize, designed to fetch, store, and manage comprehensive country data. It integrates with external APIs to provide up-to-date information, persisting it efficiently in a MySQL database. Dive into a world of global data with this powerful API! üìä It seamlessly gathers country information from external sources, stores it efficiently, and offers a suite of endpoints for robust data retrieval and management. Explore, filter, and analyze country-specific details, all while keeping your data fresh and accessible.

## Features
-   **Data Ingestion**: Automatically fetches and processes comprehensive country data (population, capital, region, flag, currency) from external APIs.
-   **Dynamic Exchange Rates**: Integrates with an external exchange rate API to provide current currency conversion rates against USD.
-   **Estimated GDP Calculation**: Dynamically calculates an estimated GDP for each country based on population and exchange rates.
-   **Data Persistence**: Stores all country and metadata within a MySQL database using Sequelize ORM, ensuring reliable data storage.
-   **On-Demand Data Refresh**: Provides a dedicated endpoint to manually trigger a full refresh of all country data from external sources, ensuring data freshness.
-   **Comprehensive Data Retrieval**: Offers flexible endpoints to query countries by name, region, currency, and allows sorting by estimated GDP.
-   **Dynamic Image Generation**: Generates a summary image (`summary.png`) showcasing total countries and the top 5 countries by estimated GDP, accessible via an API endpoint.
-   **Data Deletion**: Allows secure deletion of specific country records from the database by name.
-   **API Status Monitoring**: Provides an endpoint to check the current status of the API, including total countries stored and the timestamp of the last data refresh.

## Getting Started
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Uthmanduro/Currency-Converter-API.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Currency-Converter-API
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Database Setup**: Ensure you have a MySQL server running. Create a new database for the project (e.g., `country_db`). The application will synchronize models on startup.

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and populate it with the following required variables:

-   `PORT`: The port on which the server will listen for incoming requests.
    -   Example: `PORT=3000`
-   `DATABASE_URL`: Your MySQL connection string, including user, password, host, port, and database name.
    -   Example: `DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/your_database_name`
-   `CACHE_IMAGE_PATH`: The relative path where the dynamically generated summary image will be stored.
    -   Example: `CACHE_IMAGE_PATH=cache/summary.png`

## How to Use
After successfully installing dependencies and configuring environment variables, you can start the API server and interact with its endpoints.

1.  **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```
    The server will initiate, typically on port 3000 (or the port you've configured in your `.env` file). You should see a confirmation message in your console, such as `Server listening on port 3000`.

2.  **Interact with the API**: You can use various tools like cURL, Postman, Insomnia, or directly your web browser (for GET requests) to send requests to the documented API endpoints. Ensure the server is running before attempting to send requests.

## API Documentation

### Base URL
`http://localhost:3000` (or your configured host and port)

### Endpoints

#### `POST /countries/refresh`
Triggers a full refresh of country data from external APIs, updating existing records, creating new ones, and regenerating the summary image. This process might take a few moments.

**Request**:
No request body required.

```json
{
  "message": "Refresh successful",
  "total_countries": 250,
  "last_refreshed_at": "2023-10-27T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Errors**:
-   `503 Service Unavailable`: `{"error": "External data source unavailable", "details": "Could not fetch data from Countries API"}` (if one of the integrated external APIs is unreachable or unresponsive).
-   `500 Internal Server Error`: Generic server error that occurred during the refresh process.

#### `GET /countries`
Retrieves a list of all countries stored in the database. Supports filtering by region or currency, and sorting by estimated GDP.

**Request**:
Query Parameters (all are optional):
-   `region`: Filter countries by their geographical region (e.g., `Europe`, `Africa`).
-   `currency`: Filter countries by their primary currency code (e.g., `USD`, `EUR`).
-   `sort`: Specify the sorting order for the results.
    -   `gdp_desc`: Sort by `estimated_gdp` in descending order.
    -   `gdp_asc`: Sort by `estimated_gdp` in ascending order.
No request body required.

**Example Request**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/countries?region=Europe&sort=gdp_desc"
